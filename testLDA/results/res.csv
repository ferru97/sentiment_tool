It was at least the fifth quarter in a row that Alcoa had the company delivered of better-than-expected profit. It also gave investors a reason to hope companies as a whole might have done deliver better earnings results than feared.""The company is on the right track to grow profits at a higher rate in the future,"" says William Selesky analyst at Argus Research.Investors cautiously eyed Alcoa's results - not just because it's one of the first big companies to report - it's also been a beacon of strength. Alcoa is one of just 12 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 to have beaten earnings expectations for at least the four straight quarters by 10% or more. The company is also involved in many areas of the economy ranging from aerospace to automotive and has large customers overseas. Shares of Alcoa closed up 24 cents, or 1.8%, to $13.67 in regular trading, but declined about 2% in afterhours trading.Beating earnings was no small order for Alcoa, since analysts' expectations have been rising. Alcoa needed to boost adjusted profit by 189% from year-ago levels just to meet expectations. Adjusted profit actually rose 211%.It's important for earnings beats - like Alcoa's - to continue to maintain investors' comfort level with current stock valuations. Stocks have marched higher despite the fact an ""earnings recession"" is expected in the first quarter. Analysts are calling for profit reported by companies in the S&P 500 to fall roughly 3% in the first quarter, says S&P Capital IQ. That's disappointing since analysts back in January thought earnings would rise 5.6%. And it's a huge letdown from the 7.8% earnings growth in the fourth quarter of last year.Investors aren't panicked just yet. The earnings decline for the first quarter is based on estimates. Companies typically beat earnings estimates and that could bring the actual growth rate during the quarter to closer to flat or even in the growth territory. So far, 19 companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings and 16 have beaten expectations, says S&P Capital IQ based on data through Tuesday. And that doesn't include Alcoa, yet.The earnings decline is also a bit of a distortion. A vast majority of the expected earnings recession is due to the implosion of oil profits. Analysts expect first-quarter profit by S&P 500 energy companies to plummet 64%. That more than counteracts the fact analysts expect profit in five of the 10 S&P 500 industry sector to grow. Financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary companies are seen putting up the biggest growth during the quarter of 10.9%, 9.1% and 7.3% respectively.But the fact remains many of the easy profit gains - due to cost cutting - are evaporating and companies need to find new drivers of demand. Companies in the S&P 500 are also expected to post 1.1% lower revenue during the quarter, creating a squeeze from the top. Alcoa may have beaten profit forecasts, but its quarterly revenue of $5.8 billion missed expectations by 2%, says S&P Capital IQ.One wildcard for Alcoa - and other companies - is global growth. And that's something investors will be watching for as earnings season unfolds. ""Assuming decent global economy growth, Alcoa is still a very undervalued stock,"" Selesky says.","(0, '0.021*""earnings"" + 0.017*""companies"" + 0.015*""profit"" + 0.014*""investors"" + 0.014*""alcoa"" + 0.013*""quarter"" + 0.012*""says"" + 0.011*""expectations"" + 0.010*""first"" + 0.010*""growth""')","(1, '0.032*""earnings"" + 0.025*""companies"" + 0.024*""quarter"" + 0.022*""alcoa"" + 0.022*""profit"" + 0.016*""growth"" + 0.015*""expectations"" + 0.015*""says"" + 0.014*""first"" + 0.013*""investors""')","(2, '0.033*""alcoa"" + 0.032*""earnings"" + 0.022*""profit"" + 0.022*""companies"" + 0.021*""quarter"" + 0.017*""analysts"" + 0.014*""first"" + 0.012*""investors"" + 0.012*""expectations"" + 0.012*""says""')"
